        Zurutto’s delectable miso ramen is an authentic Japanese dish from
        Hokkaido, the birth place of Sapporo miso ramen. When we visited the
        famous Ramen Alley of Hokkaido we knew we had to bring a taste of the
        city’s dish home to New York City. Using locally sourced produce and
        only the freshest ingredients, we hope to transport every customer to
        snowy Japan, if only just for a bite.
